/*     In JSP, java code can be written inside the jsp page using the scriptlet tag. Let's see what are the scripting elements first.
JSP Scripting elements

The scripting elements provides the ability to insert java code inside the jsp. There are three types of scripting elements:

    scriptlet tag
    expression tag
    declaration tag
    
    JSP scriptlet tag

 A scriptlet tag is used to execute java source code in JSP. Syntax is as follows:

    <%  java source code %>    */

    <html>  
    <body>  
    <% out.print("welcome to jsp"); %>  
    </body>  
    </html>  
Example of JSP scriptlet tag that prints the user name

In this example, we have created two files index.html and welcome.jsp. The index.html file gets the username from the user and the welcome.jsp file prints the username with the welcome message.    

//File: index.html

<html>  
<body>  
<form action="welcome.jsp">  
<input type="text" name="uname">  
<input type="submit" value="go"><br/>  
</form>  
</body>  
</html> 

// File: welcome.jsp

    <html>  
    <body>  
    <%  
    String name=request.getParameter("uname");  
    out.print("welcome "+name);  
    %>  
    </form>  
    </body>  
    </html>
